    <h1>File upload demo</h1>
    <p>This project demonstrates file upload, using only standard java classes.
      File upload starts with a form like the one below. The important points
      here are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The method is POST and enctype='multipart/form-data'. This changes the
        structure of the request message to make the file transfer possible</li>
      <li>The action is the url of the servlet that will receive the request.
        The request message, with the file attached, will be sent to the
        servlet specified in the forms action attribute..</li>
      <li>Use the browse button to select the file to upload. When you have
        selected a file the filename will be displayed next to the browse
        button, and you can start the upload by clicking the upload button.</li>
      <li>Open UploadFile.java to see how the upload is handled.</li>
    </ul>

    <form method='POST' action='UploadFile' enctype='multipart/form-data'>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Select File:</th>
          <td><input type='file' name='file'/></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan='2'>
            <input type='submit' value='Upload selected file'>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </form>
  </body>
